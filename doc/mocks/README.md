# Mocks


# Mira-Titan

For initial testing of mass mapping codes we will be using Mira-Titan mocks.
They are simple enough that any strange things you see will be due to your mass mapping code.

The shears are *not* reduced shears.  The RA and Dec are mis-labelled as being in arcmin but are actually in degrees.

The raw mocks may be found on NERSC here:
/global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/projects/wl-massmap/mira-titan/

and a version with simplistic shape noise added:
/global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/projects/wl-massmap/mira-titan/v1



# Buzzard


The Buzzard mocks are more sophisticated and will be used for future mass maps.

They are on NERSC here:
