# Mocks


# Mira-Titan

For initial testing of mass mapping codes we will be using Mira-Titan mocks.
They are simple enough that any strange things you see will be due to your mass mapping code.



The raw mocks may be found on NERSC here:
/project/projectdirs/lsst/desc-wl/wl-massmap/mira-titan/

and a version with simplistic shape noise added:
/project/projectdirs/lsst/desc-wl/wl-massmap/mira-titan/v1



# Buzzard


The Buzzard mocks are more sophisticated and will be used for future mass maps.

They are on NERSC here:

/lsst/jderose/BCC/Chinchilla/Herd/Chinchilla-0/addgalspostprocess/truth
